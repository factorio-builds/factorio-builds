# Factorio game data

Factorio game data is expected to be present in this folder. You can download the game either using Steam or from the official website: https://www.factorio.com/download
**Note**: To download the required files you must **own** the game and have and login on the website. The headless version does **not** work, as it doesn't include all necessary assets!

After copying the assets, the structure in this directory should be such that this is a valid path:

`.local/volumes/factorio/data/base/graphics/icons/beacon.png`
